# Activity Detection Using Variational Autoencoders (VAE)

In this Project, We use the Variational Autoencoder in seperating football Images from ads. The VAE was trained using football images only, with this, when images from a different distribution is fed into the VAE the reconstruction loss is then considerably higher.
